### Hello!

This is my pokedex that allow you to:

- Get the paginated list of the Pomekons
- Show detail view of a selected pokemon
**(Note: this feature is mocked right now, it will show you always the pikachu data since I tried hard but the api is giving me an CORS error and I also tried with a backup URL that is very slow or some times it brokes)**
- Search pokemons by name or id
